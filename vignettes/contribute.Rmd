[fishualize](https://github.com/nschiett/fishualize) is a project that will be updated regularly. There are many fishes in the ocean that are waiting to be fishualized! You're favourite fish is currently not included in [fishualize](https://github.com/nschiett/fishualize)? Do not despair! You can make it happen! It's a piece of cake and here's how to do it:

### 1) Browse the internet or your personal folders until you find a pretty picture of your favourite fish
### 2) Go to https://coolors.co/app.
### 3) Press the camera symbol and either paste the link of a picture from the internet or upload one from your computer.
### 4) Let the fun begin! Carefully pick 5 colors that represent the beauty of your fish. 
### 5) Copy the hex color codes.
### 6) Go to https://github.com/nschiett/fishualize/issues, start a new issue with the label "enhancement" and paste the 5 colors and the species name (only latin names please). 
### 7) You're work is done! We will add your fish color palette as soon as we can. 

# Frequently asked questions

### I am having so much fun making fish color patterns and want to help more. How do I do this?   

For those feeling motivated, feel free to start an excel file with two columns (species and hex codes) like this:
